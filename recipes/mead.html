    <p><!--RECIPE DESCRIPTION-->
        Today, brewers can easily buy packaged yeast and yeast nutrients from grocery stores. 
        Vikings, on the other hand, did not have this luxury. In fact, during their time, they 
        didn’t even know what yeast was and that they needed it to make their mead. They could 
        have drawn wild yeast from the raw honey, fruits, and herbs to their mead must, 
        initiating fermentation without realizing it.</p>

        <p>Here is a mead starter recipe by Jereme Zimmerman—a writer and traditional brewing revivalist 
        who advocates natural and holistic home brewing. This mead starter, as the name suggests, can 
        help in instigating fermentation in your wild mead. You can use it as a replacement for store-
        bought yeast and brew your mead just like a Viking.</p>

    <!--unordered list of ingredients-->
    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup Raw, unfiltered honey</li>
        <li>2 cups Spring water</li>
        <li>Natural yeast - any organic fresh or dried berries, grapes, or plums</li>
        <li>An additional source of wild yeast and nutrients (Optional) – a small bunch of any wild, 
            unsprayed botanical such as wildflower petals (violets and dandelions are good)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><h2>Equipment</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>1-quart (at least) Open-mouthed vessel (glass jars or ceramic crocks are best)</li>
        <li>Wooden stir stick</li>
        <li>Clean cheesecloth, towel, or t-shirt for covering the vessel</li>
    </ol>

    <!--ordered list of steps-->
    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the honey and room temperature water into the open-mouthed vessel and mix them.</li>
        <li>Use the stir stick to dissolve the honey fully.</li>
        <li>Add the berries, dried or fresh, and the optional botanicals.</li>
        <li>Place the vessel in a warm, dark place with no direct sunlight. An ideal temperature is 
            about 70 degrees Fahrenheit or 21 degrees Celsius.</li>
        <li>Cover it with a cloth.</li>
        <li>Keep the stir stick accessible as you will need to stir the must at least three times a 
            day. This way, you can incorporate any yeast that has dropped in into the mead must. It 
            will also provide aeration to ensure a healthy fermentation.</li>
        <li>After about five days (or longer during the winter), once the mixture is fizzy and foamy, 
            your mead starter is ready.</li>
    </ol>
